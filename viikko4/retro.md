Start, Stop, Continue, More of, Less of Wheel. It is used to obtain feedback on the teams process after an interation. Length for the meeting is 10 minutes for smaller groups and up to 25 minutes for larger ones. 

Using a marker and a flip chart paper the facilitator draws up a wheel with five categories, which tries to answer the following questions: 
1) “Start”: What should we start doing that we perhaps haven’t done yet?
2) “Stop”: What should we stop doing, that’s not contributing to the project?
3) “Continue”: What is working that we want to continue to do?
4) “More of”: What should we do more of?
5) “Less of”: What should we do less of?


Glad, Sad, Mad. Is up to 60 minutes in length. Here all participants lists their issues during a sprint and categorizes them either Glad, Sad or Mad. Glad represents positive notes on the sprint or team, Sad represents the negative notes, and Mad represents even more negative issues which often include more broader subjects than just actions of the team. The team then votes on the notes to be discussed and go through them in the order of votes.
